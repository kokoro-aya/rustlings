# My Rustlings solutions

This repository hosts my submissions of the rustlings exercises, of version 5.6.1.

Files such as tests, question descriptions, cargo configs, etc. are not committed.

Due to data corruption, only last 3 chapters are available. The `closures` section (first section of the first chapter of these 3) is also not available.

## Disclaimer

This repository is only for educational purpose and mainly as a note for myself. 
If you happened to come across this repository, please refrain from directly copy-paste solutions from here.
Feel free to refer to my solutions but please always attempt a solution by yourself first.
