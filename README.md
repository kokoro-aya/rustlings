# My Rustlings solutions

This repository hosts my submissions of the rustlings exercises, of version 5.6.1.

Files such as tests, question descriptions, cargo configs, etc. are not committed. Coursewares are also omitted.

Due to data corruption, only last 3 chapters are available:

- Standard Library Types
- Fearless Concurrency
- Macros

~~It's unknown whether there is a bug of clion/rustrover or misconfiguration, but the rustlings course downloaded from the edutool have every test suite or sample input as an empty file. Downloading the repository of rustlings and make a copy-paste of these test files may solve the issue.~~

Solutions for the rustlings exercises are available in `exercises` folder. Since it's impossible to repair the courseware, I switched to the Visual Studio Code version (the official repo) and redo the exercises there.

## Disclaimer

This repository is only for educational purpose and mainly as a note for myself. 
If you happened to come across this repository, please refrain from directly copy-paste solutions from here.
Feel free to refer to my solutions but please always attempt a solution by yourself first.
